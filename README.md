# Path Finding Algorithms

This is a Gamified Demonstration of Path Finding Algorithms that allows you to visualize the different path finding algorithms. The user can generate random Maze and Finish Point. The use can then select the algorithm they want to visualize and the algorithm will find the shortest path from the start point to the finish point. The user can also use the arrow keys to solve the maze themselves.
